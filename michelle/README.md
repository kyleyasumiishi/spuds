# Marketplace on a Ethereum Platform
* Implemented a DApp to create a marketplace on Ethereum Framework.

# GitHub Page
 Local instance of [Market Place](https://zalak13.github.io/MarketPlace-DApp/)

# Inspiration:
* CraigList.
* The Distibuted Ledger Technology to have single Ledger distributed over the various nodes.This single ledger helps in deriving the history of the commodity and its flow between the different ownerships.

# What it does:
* The purpose of the DApp is to buy and sell commodities between the different accounts.
* Different Account holders can be created using the Metamask interface.
* Also the event monitoring process in order to maintain the single ledger for transactions.

# Challenges:
* Faced issues using Metamask
* Error handling
* Test case debugging
# Implementation:
* Developed using Solidity and web3.js
  * used node.js, web3 and solc compiler
  * Used truffle framework in order to the ease tdevelopement process
* Testing of smart contracts was done on 
  * testrpc
  * geth (private blockchain)
* Testing was done using javascript instead of a solidity contract creation way.
* Java script testing method used the Mocha framework
  
# Build With:
* Solidity, MetaMask, Web3js, Geth, Testrpc, Truffle, Shell script, EVM Framework.
